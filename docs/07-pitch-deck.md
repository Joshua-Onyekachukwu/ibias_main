# 🎤 IBIAS Pitch Deck Structure
*Target Audience: Pre-Seed Angel Investors & Accelerators*

## Slide 1: Title
**IBIAS**
*The AI Growth Analyst for the 99% of Merchants.*

## Slide 2: The Problem (Data Blindness)
*   **Fact:** 2 Million Shopify merchants collect data every second.
*   **Pain:** 87% of them don't know how to use it.
*   **Gap:** They can't afford a Data Scientist ($120k/yr) or Enterprise Tools like Triple Whale ($3k/yr).
*   **Result:** They guess. And 90% of e-commerce stores fail.

## Slide 3: The Solution
**Connect Store. Get a Growth Plan. In 60 Seconds.**
*   IBIAS is an AI-first dashboard that replaces complex spreadsheets with a simple, prioritized "To-Do List" for growth.
*   We don't just show you a chart of "Revenue Down 10%".
*   We tell you: *"Revenue is down because Blue T-Shirts ran out of stock. Reorder now to save $2k next week."*
