**Subject:** The "Missing Middle" in the $33B Analytics Market

Hi [Investor Name],

Companies like Triple Whale ($55M raised) have proven that merchants crave better data. But they've left behind 80% of the market: the SMBs who can't afford $300/month for analytics.

I'm Joshua, founder of **IBIAS** – the AI Analyst for the other 2 million merchants.

We are building the "Triple Whale for the rest of us." Instead of complex ad attribution for enterprises, we give SMBs a simple, AI-generated "Growth Plan" for $49/mo.

**Why Now?**
1.  **Market Gap:** Competitors are moving up-market, ignoring the massive SMB tail.
2.  **Tech Shift:** GenAI allows us to offer "Consultant-level" advice at software margins.
3.  **Traction:** We have a working MVP connecting to Shopify/WooCommerce and generating real insights today.

We are raising a pre-seed round to capture this "Missing Middle" before Shopify wakes up.

I've attached our deck. Are you open to a 10-minute feedback call next week?

Best,

Joshua Onyekachukwu
Founder, IBIAS
